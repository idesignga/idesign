            <h1 class="cs-title">The Business Card <span class="cs-color">Dilemma</span></h1>
            <p>
                Business cards are a strange niche among agencies and creative companies. A lot of people offer business cards on the side, and much like websites, you can actually get pretty far trying to make them yourself using online templates and web printing services. So why do the prices for getting custom business cards (and even custom logos for that matter) vary so much? The real answer is quite simple: <em>value</em>. New entrepreneurs are quick to overlook business cards as a simple means; just a quick way to share your contact information, so prospects can inquire with you further. Veteran business owners, however, understand that business cards can be your first major impression for any qualified lead—and first impressions count! So what should you do? Spend thousands with a dedicated designer or trust yourself to put together something great for less?
            </p>
            <h2>Our Proposal</h2>
            <p>
                The <em>iDesign</em> mission is to deliver as much value to each of our clients as possible. This means that if we can find new problems to tackle for our clients, then we want to implement solutions to those problems, not just quickly, but in the most effective ways possible too. What we have found is that it’s important to get business cards made alongside all of your other creative (even better if you can get it done with the same team). This helps maintain cohesiveness across all of your designs and adds to the rigidity of your overall business vision. This is why we choose to bundle our business card design and printing service together with your website. It allows us to deliver on all fronts at once, without you having to be concerned with the issue of price vs value.
            </p>
            <h3>Quality Business Cards By Hand</h3>
            <p>
                We believe that starting with a strong foundation is key to building anything that lasts. That’s why developing everything from the ground up is a core tenet at <em>iDesign</em>. Just like with web design, we don’t believe in using free online templates builders like Canva or Vistaprint. All of our designs are drafted in house, by a dedicated design team, so we can print unique designs that truly speak to your business vision. This also permits us the broadest flexibility in the types of business cards we can make for you. <strong>Whether it’s premium paper business cards, business fridge magnets, or special cuts like circular or leaf-shaped cards, we can make it all happen for you!</strong>

            </p>
            <h4>Now Including Custom Logo Design</h4>
            <p>
                Logo design is another aspect of starting a business that is cursed with the problem of value. How much do you think Coca-Cola paid for their logo? How about Nike or Apple? These are companies whose founders were at one point in your exact same position and had to make the tough call on who to work with to put together an appropriate vision for their companies. Now they are known globally and their logos are timeless. Luckily for you, logo design is yet another tool in our belt that we can offer to you at the same great rate, all bundled with your website and business cards. We never want price to be the factor that keeps you from establishing your business vision. And just like everything else, our logos are made by hand, with respect and care for each individual client and the needs of their business. We don’t use online logo makers. We don’t use AI. We put the extra work in to make sure what we deliver for you is perfect, every single time.
            </p>
            <h4>Now Offering Stationery and Marketing Materials</h4>
            <p>
                At <em>iDesign</em> we believe in more. That is, we want to give every single client we work with more options in how we can tackle their distinct problems. Are you not quite ready for business cards? Do you believe stickers might serve your business better? How about brochures or mail flyers? Starting in 2025, we are now offering all types of marketing material that you may choose instead of business cards, to make our New Business Owner Bundle truly unique to your business!
            </p>
            <h3>Design, Printing, and Shipping All Included</h3>
            <p>
                The best part about us bundling everything we offer into a single neat package is that at the end of the day, it will save you and your business so much money. Keeping a suite of different designers, developers, processors, and printing companies all on retainer can be incredibly expensive. And the process of getting anything made can be arduous, while you scramble to get each of those companies to communicate with one another. Ultimately, being a middleman requires you to take time away from doing the things you do best—the real work that will grow your business—and the whole process can leave you bitter and frustrated. The <em>iDesign</em> team wants to be your one-stop shop for all of this. Once you sit down with us, we will take care of the rest. That means the price for designing, processing, printing, and shipping, are all rolled into our single great bundle. No extra fees or sneaky ancillary costs. And that also means that once your website is ready, your marketing material will arrive at the exact same time. Everything can go live at once, without having to wait on anyone!
                <br />
                Choose <em>iDesign</em> for a stress-free business card process. Let us make things easier for you, so you can get back to doing what you do best!
