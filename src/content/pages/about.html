            <h2 class="cs-title">Taking a Small Town Vision Nationwide</h2>
            <p class="cs-text">
                Hi there! I'm Brian—founder and lead developer at <em>iDesign</em>. Before <em>iDesign</em>, I worked various odd jobs all over north Georgia, mostly helping friends and family grow their small businesses. I went from managing a shoe store in high school, to serving at local restaurants, to helping a friend open an independent music tutoring program all by the age of 19. While in college, I ventured into B2B sales and then helped another friend expand their computer repair business to join a nationwide franchise. As the years went on, I realized I was quickly learning more and more valuable skills, including sales, marketing, how to lead a team, and the ins-and-outs of operating small businesses. I started <em>iDesign</em> at just 23 years old with the mission of helping as many people as possible turn their business dreams into reality. My desire to learn everything I can about business is the engine that drives <em>iDesign</em>, and it is why I will continue to push this company towards bigger and better things every single day.
            </p>
            <p class="cs-text">
                I started making websites for friends and family during my time in college, and it was there where I realized many of the frustrations new entrepreneurs often run into when getting their ideas off the ground. Anyone can pay a stranger on Fiverr to throw together a website using WordPress templates or Wix, but who will maintain that site? What if the site goes down? Who do you go to when the forms stop working? How do you set up a business email? And after all that, you're still left looking for other freelancers who can design logos, get business cards made, print t-shirts, etc. All of these things are what lay the foundation for your business and brand. It's important who you choose to work with, because it can make just getting started the most difficult part. This is why I built <em>iDesign</em>. To provide a holistic solution for business owners who are serious about building great businesses. A one-stop-shop, where you can get all the support you need, while not having to wait on a half-dozen other people just to get started. And most of all, a direct line to me: a young entrepreneur with a passion for small business, and someone with an understanding of exactly where you're coming from and where you're trying to go.

                    Every part of the process was clear and precise. Brian did an amazing job explaining everything, and greatly showed his abilities in creating when I shared some pictures that had inspired me. I will most definitely refer him to colleagues and friends who are in need of help when becoming established in their careers. <strong>He was very patient and easy to work with.</strong> I will forever come to him for future endeavors!
